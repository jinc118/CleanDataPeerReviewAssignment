#This dataset is a clean and manipuatlated version of the UCI HAR dataset.
The raw data set used to generate this tidy data can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A full description of the data is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The original data contains multiple files with measurement data collected from the subject's smartphones. Details of the 

Since the purpose of this assignment was not to demonstrate an understanding of the variables, the detailed descriptions have not been included in this codebook. However, in addition to the above description, the detailed descriptions of measurements included in the finalset.txt file can be found in the file named "features_info.txt" file included in the original data set downloadable from the link provided for those who wish to learn more about the data.

#Steps used for transforming the original data (see README.MD file for detailed steps)
1. The data separated into training and test datasets for Machine Learning purpose was combined to create one dataset
2. Appropriate labels were added to the dataset for measurement variables, activities and subject identification
3. The resulting dataset was summarized to only extract average of standard deviations and means per measurement per activity per subject. Angle measurements and frequency mean were not included in this process and therefore are not reflected in the final data file.
